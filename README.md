# Calculator-React-Sounds

Calculator made with react styled components, tone.js (https://tonejs.github.io/) for the sounds, react-use-keypress (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-keypress) for key binding, and "react-tsparticles" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tsparticles) for the background.
